             Here is a brief use of all the commands :-
             
          -> add - This command has 2 parameters and it's syntax is as 
          follows - 
          
                       add(parameter1,parameter2)
          
         This command adds the 'parameter1' and 'parameter2'.
         
          -> sub - This command has 2 parameters and it's syntax is as 
          follows - 
          
                       sub(parameter1,parameter2)
          
         This command subtracts 'parameter2' from 'parameter1'.
         
         -> mul - This command has 2 parameters and it's syntax is as 
          follows - 
          
                       mul(parameter1,parameter2)
          
         This command multiplies the 'parameter1' and 'parameter2'.
         
          -> div - This command has 2 parameters and it's syntax is as 
          follows - 
          
                       div(parameter1,parameter2)
          
         This command divides 'parameter2' by 'parameter1'.
         
         -> pow - This command has 2 parameters and it's syntax is as 
          follows - 
          
                       pow(parameter1,parameter2)
          
         This command raises 'parameter1' to the power of 'parameter2'.
         
          -> nrt - This command has 2 parameters and it's syntax is as 
          follows - 
          
                       nrt(parameter1,parameter2)
          
         This command finds 'parameter2'-th root of 'parameter1'.
         
         -> fac - This command has only one parameter and it's yntax is as 
         follows :-
         
                        fac(parameter1)
                        
         This command factorises 'parameter1'.
         
         -> pri - This command has only one parameter and it's yntax is as 
         follows :-
         
                        pri(parameter1)
                        
         This command checks if 'parameter1' is a prime number or not.
         
         -> cpr - This command has only one parameter and it's yntax is as 
         follows :-
         
                        cpr(parameter1)
                        
         This command shows all the prime numbers between 1 to 'parameter1'.
         
          Please note that this program is case and syntax sensitive. Even
          adding a space can be the difference between a really frustrating
          'Invalid Command' message and the answer that you were looking 
          for.
          
          This program also does not allow multiple commands at the same time.
