This Python Program has been created in parts and one main file has access to all of them.

To run this file, you wll have to access the main file called 'ArithmeticProgram.py'. After running this file, it will access the other sub-files that contain the codes for the for various arithmetic operations that this program can do.

For starters, if you run the main file and type 'help', you will receive a help screen that will tell you all that you need to know about all the different commands and their respective syntaxes. The help will also contain info about what each command does.

If you want to view the code for each of the operations, they are named according to what their functions is.
